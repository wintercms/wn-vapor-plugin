# Laravel Vapor for Winter CMS

*Simplifies running Winter CMS projects on [Laravel Vapor](https://vapor.laravel.com)*

## Installation

This plugin is available for installation via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/).

```bash
composer require winter/wn-vapor-plugin
```

## Installation Notes (WIP)

Next, you will need to install [Vapor CLI](https://github.com/laravel/vapor-cli) â€” this tool brings Vapor to your terminal and allows you to interact with your Vapor project to create databases, caches, or trigger new deployments:

```bash
composer global require laravel/vapor-cli
```

After you have installed the Vapor CLI, you should authenticate your Vapor account using the login command:

```bash
vapor login
```

- Create vapor.yml
    - Either manually or through `vapor init`
    - vapor init
        - What is the name of this project?
        - What region do you want it in?
        - Would you like Vapor to assign vanity domains to each of your environments? (yes/no)
        - Would you like to install the laravel/vapor-core package (yes/no) (SAY NO)
- Edit vapor.yml
    - TODO
    - Replace `npm run build` with `php artisan mix:compile --production --stop-on-error`
- run `vapor deploy $env`
    "In PhpRedisConnector.php line 161: Connection refused" - your .env file uses redis but you don't have it running on the machine you're running the build from
    "In PhpRedisConnector.php line 81: Class "Redis" not found" - your configuration references phpredis as the driver for redis but your build machine doesn't have the phpredis extension installed
    "The command "npm ci && php artisan mix:compile --production --stop-on-error && rm -rf node_modules" failed. Exit Code: 127(Command not found)" - your build machine doesn't have node installed
    - Your build machine will need node / npm installed
        - `brew install node`
    - Your build machine will need either the PHPRedis extension installed or predis installed via composer on the project
       - `pecl install redis`
       or
       - `composer require predis/predis`


## Usage Notes:

### Configuration

Winter CMS includes most required environment variables in the configuration files by default, but if you have customized them or are adding Vapor support to an existing project you will need to ensure the following configuration items are set to use environment variables:

- `app.tempPath`: Should be set to `env('APP_TEMP_PATH', null)`, required for anything using temporary storage on the server (i.e. file uploads).
- `app.asset_url`: Should be set to `env('ASSET_URL', null)`, required for loading assets from the CDN that Vapor configures for you as asset files are not made available on the Vapor servers directly.
- `app.trustedHosts`: Recommended to add entries for every valid host to your application here.
- `app.trustedProxies`: Recommended to set to `**` so that your application can correctly identify the real IP address of the client making the request despite the fact that it is behind multiple layers of proxies.
- `cms.linkPolicy`: Should be set to `force` to ensure that the URL helper handles generating URLs.
- `cms.databaseTemplates`: Should be set to `true` to ensure that the database is used for storing CMS templates since the filesystem is read-only on Vapor.
- `filesystems.s3.stream_uploads`: Should be set to `true` or at least `env('AWS_S3_STREAM_UPLOADS', false)` to ensure that file uploads are streamed to S3 instead of attempting to upload them to the Vapor PHP server first, which has a low hard limit on request size which will perform worse and cause larger uploads to fail.
- `filesystems.s3.url`: Should be set to `env('AWS_URL')` to ensure that the correct URL is used for accessing files on S3, especially if you are using a CloudFront CDN in front of S3.



### Required Vapor Overrides

Laravel Vapor by default loads its own bootstrapping files which then load Laravel's bootstrapper directly. This prevents Winter's bootstrapper from running first and thus causes issues with overrides provided by Winter no longer taking effect. To fix this, copy the `httpHandler.php` and `runtimes.php` file from the `/stubs` folder into your project root.



### Returning Binary Responses (File Downloads)

See https://docs.vapor.build/1.0/projects/development.html#binary-responses. Basically `$response->headers->set('X-Vapor-Base64-Encode', 'True');` needs to be set on the response object for any binary responses (i.e. file downloads).



### Caching

Use Redis, DynamoDB doesn't currently support being flushed in Laravel which is required for cache clearing through the Winter backend.



### webmanifest & .json files:

You will need to create manual routes for `.webmanifest` & `.json` files if they are not being served from your CDN. See https://github.com/laravel/vapor-cli/commit/30f55eff6ebc22e30796e9e033536894a28b0824#commitcomment-46973546 for more details.
